### Exercise 17.1-1
***
If the set of stack operations included a MULTIPUSH operation, which pushes k items onto the stack, would the O(1) bound on the amortized cost of stack operations continue to hold?

### `Answer`
MULTIPUSH has k PUSHes, which means that the stack can only do k POPs. So yes, the bound still holds.


### Exercise 17.1-2
***
Show that if a DECREMENT operation were included in the k-bit counter example, n operations could cost as much as theta(nk) time.

### `Answer`
In the worst case, going from 1[k-1 0's] (ie. 1000 -> 0111) takes k flips. Could do any sequence of increment and decrement from 1000 -> 0111 -> 1000 -> 0111 (n times), which is theta(nk).

###Exercise 17.1-3
***
Suppose we perform a sequence of n operations on a data structure in which the *i*th operation on a data structure in which the *i*th operation costs *i* if *i* is anexact power of 2, and 1 otherwise. Use aggregate analysis to determine the amortized cost per operation.

### `Answer`

i	cost

1	1

2	2

3	1

4	4

5	1

6	1

7	1

8	8

...

Total cost is
